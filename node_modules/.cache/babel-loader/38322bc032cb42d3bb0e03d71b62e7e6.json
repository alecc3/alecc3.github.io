I developed my skill by dedicating myself to improvement, and this philosophy and work ethic is something I wish to translate toward all my passions. Competition is an important part of my drive, and motivates me by inspiring me to work harder than my peers. I have an innately strong drive and appetite for success, and I want to apply this ambition and passion to academics and my future career.
